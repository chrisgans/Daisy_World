# Daisy_World
Excercise for Uni

This package simulates a daisy world with white and black daisies.

The excercises (daisy_world_exc_1-5) simulate the survival of the two daisy types for different parameter changes. 

If started as a main the five excercises  import automatically the functions and parameters from model_functions.py 
afterwards the simultion is run and plots are generated in the output folder.
